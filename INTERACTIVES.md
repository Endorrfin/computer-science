# INTERACTIVES.md — The Touchable Inventory (binding contract)

> Companion to `CLAUDE.md` §5/§6. **Every core entity must be touchable.** This file names
> every interactive in the guide; authoring sessions implement from here (keys = registry
> keys). Adding/renaming interactives happens **here first**, then in code.
> Escape hatch: where an interactive adds no real insight, a steppable figure + table is
> the floor — decoration for its own sake is banned.

**Types**
- `[HERO]` — flagship simulator/emulator; play/pause/step/speed/reset; the chapter is built around it
- `[micro]` — focused single-idea sim; 1–3 controls; embeds inline
- `[fig]` — steppable animated SVG figure (prev/next/auto; never a GIF in-app)
- `[quiz]` — predict-the-behavior widget (every chapter has ≥1; only *custom* ones listed)
- `[boss]` — part capstone challenge, hosted inside the named hero
- 🔊 — optional sound; ⚠ — heavy build cost, plan session time

## Learning engine — Katas (kata runner v1, S7)

In-browser coding exercises with instant tests, run in a **sandboxed, time-boxed Web
Worker** (Blob-URL worker; no DOM; `importScripts` blocked; hard timeout kills infinite
loops — CLAUDE.md §10). Each kata carries a prompt, a **TS signature** (shown for teaching),
a **JS starter**, hidden **tests**, and a **reference solution** locked by
`scripts/test-katas.ts`. v1 batch (~10) is focused on **P4-so-far** — Big-O reasoning +
linear structures — and grows one part at a time (§6). Route `#/katas`; per-chapter
`kataIds` deep-link the relevant ones.

## Shared framework (built once at S1, reused ~90 times)

- **`SimShell`** — chrome for every `[HERO]`/`[micro]`: play/pause/step/reset, speed slider,
  param controls slot, keyboard bindings (space/←/→), ARIA live region announcing state
  changes, `prefers-reduced-motion` → auto-switches to step mode. Consistent look = the
  guide's signature.
- **`FigureStepper`** — every `[fig]`: SVG frames with prev/next/auto and a frame caption;
  no GIFs in-app (GIF export only as marketing assets later).
- **`PredictQuiz`** — every `[quiz]`: question → commit an answer → reveal with animated
  explanation (the sim itself replays the truth where possible).
- **Cross-sim continuity:** RAM grid, cache overlay, and packet/envelope visuals reuse the
  *same* visual components across parts (ch.6→8→14→23, ch.26→27→28→31) — entities look
  identical wherever they appear.

## Inventory census (S0 baseline)

18 figures, 16 quizzes, 78 interview Qs, 20 katas** across 16 live chapters (`npm run qa`
prints the running census and enforces the per-chapter minimums — CLAUDE.md §6 mandate).
