# INTERACTIVES.md — The Touchable Inventory (binding contract)

> Companion to `CLAUDE.md` §5/§6. **Every core entity must be touchable.** This file names
> every interactive in the guide; authoring sessions implement from here (keys = registry
> keys). Adding/renaming interactives happens **here first**, then in code.
> Escape hatch: where an interactive adds no real insight, a steppable figure + table is
> the floor — decoration for its own sake is banned.

**Types**
- `[HERO]` — flagship simulator/emulator; play/pause/step/speed/reset; the chapter is built around it
- `[micro]` — focused single-idea sim; 1–3 controls; embeds inline
- `[fig]` — steppable animated SVG figure (prev/next/auto; never a GIF in-app)
- `[quiz]` — predict-the-behavior widget (every chapter has ≥1; only *custom* ones listed)
- `[boss]` — part capstone challenge, hosted inside the named hero
- 🔊 — optional sound; ⚠ — heavy build cost, plan session time

- `subset-sum-decide` — reachable-sums DP for the NP-complete decision problem *(ch.21)*
- `verify-hamiltonian` — the easy "check a certificate" side of an NP problem *(ch.21)*

## Shared framework (built once at S1, reused ~90 times)

- **`SimShell`** — chrome for every `[HERO]`/`[micro]`: play/pause/step/reset, speed slider,
  param controls slot, keyboard bindings (space/←/→), ARIA live region announcing state
  changes, `prefers-reduced-motion` → auto-switches to step mode. Consistent look = the
  guide's signature.
- **`FigureStepper`** — every `[fig]`: SVG frames with prev/next/auto and a frame caption;
  no GIFs in-app (GIF export only as marketing assets later).
- **`PredictQuiz`** — every `[quiz]`: question → commit an answer → reveal with animated
  explanation (the sim itself replays the truth where possible).
- **Cross-sim continuity:** RAM grid, cache overlay, and packet/envelope visuals reuse the
  *same* visual components across parts (ch.6→8→14→23, ch.26→27→28→31) — entities look
  identical wherever they appear.

## Inventory census (S0 baseline)

**17 HERO** (incl. stack-map + grand-traversal; P4 carries 3, P1/P2/P6 carry 2 each) ·
**65 micro** · **36 fig** (+complexity-ladder, +hash-anatomy at S7; +tree-rotation,
+rb-intuition, +merge-recursion, +sort-stability at S8) · **10 boss** (each with a badge) ·
**kata runner** (10 katas at v1, S7 → **20 katas** after S8; **24** after S9; **30** after
S10's +6 automata/computability/complexity batch; **34** after S11's +4 scheduling/paging
batch; **38** after S12's +4 files/concurrency batch; **44** after S13's +6 networks batch;
**48** after S14's +4 data batch) · quizzes in every chapter. As of **S14** the live build
carries **64 sims, 29 figures, 30 quizzes, 151 interview Qs, 48 katas** across **30 live
chapters** (`npm run qa` prints the running census and enforces the per-chapter minimums —
CLAUDE.md §6 mandate). **Part 5 · Theory
complete** (ch.19–21 + the *Halting Oracle* boss inside `turing-machine`). **Part 6 · Operating
Systems complete** (ch.22–25): S11 shipped ch.22–23 with the `scheduler-sim` HERO; **S12** shipped
ch.24 (Files & storage, `inode-explorer` HERO) and ch.25 (Concurrency, `deadlock-lab` HERO) with
the *Deadlock Breaker* boss. **Part 7 · Networks complete** (ch.26–28): **S13** shipped ch.26
(`packet-journey` HERO), ch.27 (TCP & UDP, `tcp-lab` HERO with the Reno sawtooth) and ch.28 (The
Web) with the 🦈 *Wire Shark* boss inside `tcp-lab` (debug three broken handshakes). **Part 8 ·
Data complete** (ch.29–30): **S14** shipped ch.29 (Databases, the `btree-lab` **B+-tree** HERO +
`isolation-anomalies` + `join-visualizer`) with the 📇 *Query Planner* boss inside `btree-lab`
(choose indexes to fit three workloads under a page-read budget), and ch.30 (Distributed systems,
Raft-style `election-toy` + `cap-explorer` + `replication-lag` + the `logical-clocks` figure).
